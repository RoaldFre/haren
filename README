Haren -- a HAskell RENderer.
Author: Roald Frederickx

This renderer is implemented as an assignment for the Computer Graphics 
course at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.
It consists of two main parts:

  - Haras (pronounced 'harass'):
    A Haskell Rasterizer (currently only very basic functionality)

  - Haray (pronounced 'hurray'):
    A Haskell Raytracer

See the 'examples' directory for some pretty pictures!
